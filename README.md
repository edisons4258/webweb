I'm trying to make a website, but it's been tricky for me.
I'm realizing now that there are certain other things that I need to have downloaded onto my machine in order for me to be able to use Jekyll pages.
Watching Youtube tutorials in combination with reading from my textbook and the github support pages seems to be like the most effective strategy for me to figure out GitHub pages. I'll see if I make any progress.
